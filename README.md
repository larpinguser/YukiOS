> A browser-based desktop environment running in a single web page, combining windowed multitasking, persistent storage,
> emulators, tools, and a large collection of applications and games.

YukiOS turns a browser tab into a working desktop-style space with draggable windows, multitasking, file handling,
emulators, productivity tools, and interactive apps. Everything runs locally in the browser with persistent storage and
session state.

It supports running Flash content, DOS programs, console emulation, WebAssembly apps, and standard web applications side
by side.

Its built entirely in vanilla javascript/typescript without any frameworks.
